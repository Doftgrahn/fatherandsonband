        <h2>About the band</h2>

        <p>
          The Father & Son Band really began as gentle evening tradition of a father singing his son to sleep. At age four, Erik, the son, first helped dad, Jimmy, on stage, singing Old McDonald into a microphone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward a dozen years, and Erik’s close friend, Elie Sandberg, joined father and son on a trip to Austria.
          While enjoying hikes around the Salzkammergut, the three worked on harmonies, and Jimmy organized a few gigs in local restaurants.
          Each summer, the number of gigs seemed to increase, and slowly, so did the band members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another friend from school, Simon Grahn joined the band with his saxophone, flute, clarinet, and harmonica.
          And eventually Viktor Lenberg added his bass and Mickel Löwenius brought his drums into the group.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Elie is not traveling with the band, as he has commitments with his baby son, so the band is comprised of the remaining five members.
          <br> With a mixture of rock ’n' roll, country, blues, evergreens, and original compositions, we always strive to have as much fun on stage as we possibly can! And we live for the music! </p>
